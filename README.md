# Java CRUD Application with GUI and db4o

## Overview
This is a Java desktop application built with NetBeans that demonstrates a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** system for managing products. The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons to insert, search, modify, delete, show, and exit. 

The project is connected to a **db4o object-oriented database**, which stores all product information persistently.

## Features
- **Insert products**: Add new products with code, name, quantity, and description.  
- **Search products**: Find a product by its code.  
- **Update products**: Modify existing products.  
- **Delete products**: Remove products from the database.  
- **Show all products**: Display a list of all stored products.  
- **Automatic database handling**: The `.yap` database file is created automatically when running the program.

## Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or higher  
- NetBeans IDE (or any Java IDE)  
> Note: All required db4o libraries are already included in the project, so no additional installation is needed.
